# Segmentation Analysis

This folder contains the code to replicate the TDA baseline results.

Start by running `calculate_cubicial_persistence_entire_video.py` for all videos of the data set. `run_example_array.sh` is an example script deploying an array job to the cluster used for the thesis research. 

Then `analyze_cubical_persistence_entire_video.ipynb` can be used to reproduce the analysis presented in the thesis. The Notebook `tda_cubicial_entire_video.ipynb` contain initial experiments with the TDA approach and produce plots visualizing the process which are used in the thesis.
